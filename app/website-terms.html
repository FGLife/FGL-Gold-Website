          <h3 class="blue-heading">Collection of Information from Site Visitors </h3>  
        <p>If you send comments or questions via e-mail to any mail box provided on our sites, we will share your
          communications with our customer service representatives and those employees or agents most capable of
          addressing your questions and concerns. We will retain your communication until we have done our very best to
          provide you with a complete and satisfactory response and then we will either discard it or, in some cases,
          archive it. </p>

          <p>Please note that, unless we expressly advise you otherwise, the e-mail facilities at our
        sites do not provide a means for completely secure and private communications between us. Like most, if not all,
        non-encrypted Internet e-mail communications, your e-mail may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users,
        without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please
        do not use e-mail to communicate information to us that you consider to be confidential. If you wish, you may
        contact Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life instead via telephone at the numbers provided at various locations on our
        sites.</p>

          <p>You should also be aware that when you visit our web site, we collect certain information that
        does not identify you personally, but provides us with "usage data", such as the number of visitors we receive,
        what pages are visited most often, and what browser and domain name you are using.  Additionally, we may gather
        non-personally identifiable demographics and interests data about you using a feature provided by Google
        Analytics through use of “cookie” technology (described below).  This information my include demographics data,
        such as your age and gender, and information about your general interests, based on Google’s algorithm.  None of
        the demographics and interests information that we will gather will be personally identifiable, and this
        information will not be used in any way relating to your insurance application or policy.  Learn more about <a
          href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/"> Google's privacy policy</a>.  The sole purpose of this data is
        to continually improve the usefulness of the information we provide at this site.</p>

          <p>Like most commercial
        web sites, we may also use on this site what is known as web browser "cookie" technology or other online
        tracking technologies and analytical tools, to customize our websites, mobile applications, and social media
        interactions to enhance your overall customer experience. A "cookie" is a non-executable element of data that
        a web site can send to your browser when you link to that site. By assigning a unique data element to each
        visitor, the web site is then able to recognize repeat users, track usage patterns and better serve you when
        you return to that site. The cookie does not extract personal information about you. This cookie resides on
        your computer until your Internet browser is turned off and is used to make it easier for you to navigate
        among different pages at this website. This cookie does not collect any personally identifiable information
        about you. Most browsers provide a simple procedure that will enable you to control whether you want to
        receive cookies by notifying you when a web site is about to deposit a cookie file. You can also opt out of
        Google Analytics by downloading and installing the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin">Opt-out
          Browser Add-on</a>. Our mobile and social media applications may also collect non-personally identifiable
        demographic information (such as age, sex, and city/state location) about the users of each application. This
        website contains hyperlinks to other websites on the Internet which we do not control, are not governed by our
        privacy practices and policies and for which we are not responsible. Before you provide information to any of
        these other websites, you should review their terms of service (or similar legal terms) and their privacy
        policies so that you know what information is collected by the website and what use or disclosure may be made
        of information you provide to the website.  Our website does not engage in collecting personally identifiable
        information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We have
        not authorized any third party to collect personally identifiable information about your online activities
        over time and across different websites when you visit our website. Thus, our website does not respond to web
        browser "do not track" track signals or other similar mechanisms.</p>


        <h3 class="blue-heading">Miscellaneous </h3>  
        <p>These terms and conditions shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
          laws of the State of Iowa applicable to agreements made and to be performed in Iowa. You agree that any legal
          action or proceeding between Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life and you for any purpose concerning this site shall
          be
